# Simon-Game
## The Simon game is the exciting electronic game of lights and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct sequence

Simon is a classic electronic memory game that tests your ability to remember and reproduce sequences of lights and sounds. The game consists of a round device with four colored buttons, each associated with a unique sound. Here are the basic rules and regulations for playing Simon:

**Objective:**
The objective of Simon is to follow and repeat increasingly longer sequences of button presses and sounds. The game continues until the player makes a mistake or fails to repeat a sequence correctly.

**Components:**
1. Simon Game Unit: This is the main device with the four colored buttons and lights.
2. Start Button: Press this button to begin a new game.
3. Score Display: The game keeps track of your score (number of correct sequences).
4. Four Colored Buttons: Each button is associated with a different color (typically red, blue, green, and yellow).
5. Sound and Light Indicators: Each button produces a specific sound and lights up when pressed or as part of the sequence.

**Gameplay:**
1. Press the Start Button to initiate the game.

2. Simon will play a sequence of button presses and sounds. It starts with a single button press.

3. Your task is to remember and reproduce the sequence exactly as Simon played it. To do this, press the buttons in the same order they were shown by Simon.

4. Simon will continue to add one more button to the sequence each time you correctly replicate the pattern. The game gets progressively harder as the sequences become longer.

5. If you make a mistake and press the wrong button or press them in the wrong order, the game ends, and your score is displayed.

6. If you successfully complete a sequence, Simon will play a longer one, and you must continue to repeat it accurately to increase your score.

7. The game can continue until you make a mistake.

**Winning:**
There isn't a traditional "winning" condition in Simon, as the game's purpose is to challenge your memory and reflexes. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by accurately repeating increasingly longer sequences. Players often compete to beat their personal best or challenge others to see who can achieve the highest score.

**Scoring:**
The score in Simon represents the number of sequences you've successfully completed without making a mistake. The higher your score, the more challenging the game becomes.

**Variations:**
There are different versions and variations of Simon with additional features, including timed modes, multiplayer modes, and more.

**Regulations:**
1. Play fair and follow the game's rules without attempting to cheat or manipulate the device.

2. Be cautious not to accidentally press the wrong button, as it can end your game.

3. Follow any specific rules or variations outlined in the instructions provided with your specific version of Simon.

**Simon is a fun and challenging game that tests your memory and concentration skills. Enjoy playing and strive to beat your own high score!**
